        We're getting your servers metrics (using Prometheus) and characteristics to learn when your server is not utilized.<br/><br/>
        Most applications & servers have a recurring pattern, e.g. an online shop often has low traffic and load at night. <br/>
        We find those gaps and fill them with useful computing tasks. <br/> <br/>
        You can watch your servers metrics and graphs based on Grafana via the user area. <br/>

       Once we understand the load patterns of your servers and when there are some gaps 
       where its safe to run some additional computing, 
       we bring load to your machines via our scheduler. <br/><br/>
       We love Open Source. This is why the computing tasks are packaged as <strong>Docker</strong> Containers (simple!) 
       and delivered and orchestrated via <strong>Kubernetes</strong>.<br/><br/>
       The workloads come from our selected industry partners and are secured & verifed by us.

      <p class="text c--grey">
        While computing tasks are running, we continuously monitor your server load & metrics (10/sec intervals). <br/>
        To ensure that if your load suddenly rises, we immediately switch off / reduce the computing tasks.<br/>
        <strong>never impacting your actual applications</strong>.<br/><br/>
        On top, we provide an emergency switch (or you can just kill the worker) to turn off our computing tasks at a moments notice.<br/><br/> <br/>

      <p class="text c--grey">
        When we use the the capacity of your otherwise unused servers, 
        we can provide you both: another revenue source, as well as reduce the need 
        for new servers to be provisioned. Of course this also wastes less power, thus reducing CO2 output.<br/>
        Sharing Economy! It's like couch surfing for computing tasks, 
        welcome computing tasks to your servers couch
        and earn some money & make new friends (your CPUs will love the new tenant).  <br/>
