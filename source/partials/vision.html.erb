      Shouldn't we be utilizing this free computing capacity?</h1>
    <p class="text text--big">
      Most infrastructure is designed for peaks and to handling spikes in traffic, leaving a lot of unused spare capacity.<br/>
      We're utilizing this free power by connecting server owners with increasing computing demand (e.g. for simulations, rendering or AI/ML).

      <b> TRUE CLOUD COMPUTING </b><br/>
      Amazon spearheaded the Cloud Business with AWS and the idea to make their own spare capacity (as well old server hardware) 
      available to anyone at very competitive prices.<br/><br/>
      The initial vision was that anyone should be able to run their workloads on Amazons infrastructure, 
      in turn driving their utilization rates up from 20% to 60-70%.
      They commoditized compute-capacity: ergo the first Cloud.<br/><br/>
      
      Weâ€™re not here to reinvent the wheel, but weâ€™re certainly taking it to the next level. A Cloud at Scale.
      Combining all globally available spare and reserve capacity into a massive Cloud officially known as Helio.
